# Lifestream

This is the code for David Blume's lifestream project. It was 
[started in 2008](https://www.plurk.com/p/2lrqa), so it uses Python 2.

I have a [blog post describing it](https://david.dlma.com/blog/my-lifestream).

## What is a Lifestream?

A lifestream is an aggregation of your user activity feeds from across the
internet. Essentially, it can be thought of as an automatic online diary.
It writes itself.

## The Basic Idea

This script is run on a recurring basis by a cronjob or something similar,
and it reads a bunch of RSS or Atom feeds, and from those it aggregates the
entries into a useful website.

## This is an Archive

While the lifestream is still running as of this writing, it's not being
actively maintained.

## Is it any good?

[Yes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434).
